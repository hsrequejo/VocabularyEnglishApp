# VocabularyEnglishApp (in progress)
The aidea here is to make an app that shows a word in English, play the pronunciation audio and four alternatives for transaltions in English.

There will be a score and a timer.

There will be two game modes, *Practice Mode* (no time) and *30s*. I will add more game modes after if possible. (TODO: Make a manual for how to add a new game mode)

Need to do it scalable for easy adition of words and translations.
